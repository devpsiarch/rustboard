# Rustboard
Rustboard is a opensource project that i want to be a GUI app that uses the UCI protocol to draw the chessboard for your engine without being dependent on anything , that is by the way written in rust.

# why ?
This was made just as an excuse for me to write more rust and i happen to be writting my own chess engine.
